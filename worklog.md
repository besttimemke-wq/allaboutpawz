# Project Worklog

---
Task ID: 1
Agent: Main agent (Z.ai Code)
Task: Import https://github.com/allaboutpawz901-beep/AAPAWZ.git in its entirety (src, supabase, env) — Supabase-only architecture, NO Prisma, and request the real Supabase keys from the user.

Work Log:
- Cloned the repo to /tmp/AAPAWZ (244 files: Next.js 16 app for "All About Pawz" dog grooming salon — public site + DAWG admin CRM + Supabase backend).
- Read user's uploaded /home/z/my-project/upload/env.example — it contains only PLACEHOLDER values (your-project.supabase.co / your-anon-key / your-service-role-key), so real keys must come from the user.
- Imported into /home/z/my-project:
  - src/ (entire tree, byte-identical except documented changes below — verified via md5sum tree comparison)
  - supabase/ (schema.sql with 47 tables, migrations/0001_add_dog_photo.sql, functions/send-email edge function)
  - public/assets/ (27 images), logo.svg, robots.txt
  - next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, components.json, postcss.config.mjs, eslint.config.mjs, .env.example
  - .env created from env.example structure (placeholders, DATABASE_URL/SQLite section removed)
- REMOVED ALL PRISMA (user directive: Prisma does not exist, no fallback, all tables in Supabase):
  - Deleted prisma/ folder, db/ folder, src/lib/db.ts
  - Removed prisma + @prisma/client from package.json; removed db:push/db:generate/db:migrate/db:reset scripts
  - Rewrote src/lib/repo.ts as Supabase-ONLY (same exported surface: repo, supabaseReady, supabaseConfig, usingSupabase, getBackend, CmsResource). Placeholder env values (your-project.supabase.co etc.) are treated as unconfigured. Reads return empty data while unconfigured (site renders); writes return clear "Supabase is not configured" errors.
- Robustness fixes (minimal, behavior-identical once keys are set):
  - Lazy Stripe init in 5 API routes (module-level `new Stripe(undefined)` crashed route modules when key absent): bookings/checkout, checkout, stripe/webhook, stripe/customer-portal, auth/invite, consultations/convert, customers — also returns clear 503 messages when STRIPE_SECRET_KEY missing.
  - Lazy Supabase client init in api/auth/session and api/auth/invite.
  - auth/client.ts: placeholder URL/key when env unset so admin/login pages render instead of crashing (createBrowserClient throws on empty strings).
  - /api/customers: Supabase write wrapped → clean 503 with reason (wizard displays it).
- package.json: added @supabase/ssr, @supabase/supabase-js, @phosphor-icons/react, @fullcalendar/* (5), resend, stripe; recharts upgraded to repo's ^3.10.1; dropped prisma/@prisma/client/nodemailer/pg/motion/html-react-parser (unused in src).
- bun install OK. Dev server started (port 3000, persistent via double-fork subshell; note: sandbox reaps normal background processes between tool calls).
- Fixed one transient self-inflicted syntax error in api/customers/route.ts (brace mismatch from my edit — resolved; final file compiles).
- NOTE: the "[m" display artifact made repo's admin/page.tsx line 59 LOOK corrupted ("obileOpen") — it was actually valid; restored pristine file (md5-verified).

Verification (agent-browser):
- All 13 routes return 200: /, /about, /services, /pricing, /gallery, /faq, /shop, /book, /contact, /process, /admin, /login, /account
- APIs: /api/cms/status, /api/availability (7am–6pm 30-min slots, Mon closed), /api (health), /api/cms/* reads, /api/auth/session — all 200; writes correctly 503 "Supabase not configured" pending keys.
- Homepage renders full site chrome (10-section nav, hero, services, testimonials fallback), no page errors, no console errors.
- Booking wizard (v2, 9 steps): steps 1–2 fill correctly (store verified via localStorage); step 2 stops at customer creation with the clear "Supabase not configured" API error — expected until keys arrive.
- Admin renders LandingLoginView (Pet Parent / Salon Staff portals) with no errors; admin's /api/cms/* + /api/analytics/revenue calls all 200.
- Contact form submits (repo's own fail-soft pattern; write lands once keys are set).
- Mobile 390px: no horizontal scroll; footer in natural flow on long + short pages.
- bun run lint: 0 errors, 4 warnings (all inherited from repo's own code).

Stage Summary:
- Repo fully imported; Supabase is the ONLY backend (47 tables in supabase/schema.sql); zero Prisma anywhere.
- App runs and renders; site + admin verified end-to-end via agent-browser.
- BLOCKED ON USER INPUT: real Supabase keys (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY) — plus optional Stripe (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET) and Resend (RESEND_API_KEY) keys — to be pasted into /home/z/my-project/.env, then dev server restart.
- With keys: all data (customers, dogs, bookings, payments, staff, grooming lookups, CMS content) flows from the user's Supabase project; schema is already applied there per user ("all tables in Supabase").

Task ID: 2
Agent: Main agent (Z.ai Code)
Task: Activate the app with the user's real keys (Supabase + Stripe live + Resend + admin email) and verify the full stack end-to-end.

Work Log:
- User supplied all production keys: Supabase URL/anon/service-role (+ management token sbp_…, direct & pooler Postgres strings), Stripe live pk/sk/whsec, Resend send-only key, ADMIN_EMAIL=allaboutpawz901@gmail.com.
- Wrote real values into /home/z/my-project/.env using the exact var names the code reads (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SUPABASE_URL/ANON legacy aliases, SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, RESEND_API_KEY, EMAIL_FROM, SALON_NOTIFY_EMAIL, ADMIN_EMAILS). Postgres connection strings kept as reference comments (app talks to PostgREST, not pg).
- Killed old dev server; restarted persistently (setsid/nohup, tee dev.log). Ready in 1926ms.
- Direct Supabase REST validation: services table returns real rows; /auth/v1/health 200.
- Stripe key validated read-only (GET /v1/balance → livemode true). Resend key is send-restricted (401 on GET /domains — expected for a send-only key; app only sends).
- /api/cms/status → {"backend":"supabase","supabaseConfigured":true,"resendReady":true}; /api/cms/* now serve real Supabase rows.
- agent-browser verification: homepage renders real services from Supabase; booking wizard v2 advanced NAME→CONTACT→DOG (breed combobox populated from live dog_breeds); POST /api/customers 201 → verified live Supabase row (status ACTIVE) AND live Stripe customer cus_VCSBEs1AwzUE4N linked back; admin renders Pet Parent/Staff portals + Supabase auth login, all /api/cms/* + /api/analytics/revenue 200; zero console/page errors.
- Mobile 390px: no horizontal scroll (home, contact); footer in natural flow on long pages.
- Cleaned up verification data: deleted test customer row from Supabase (verified gone) and deleted Stripe test customer (deleted:true).
- Final dev.log: zero errors; all routes 200.

Stage Summary:
- App is fully LIVE against the user's real Supabase project, live Stripe account, and Resend. Zero Prisma anywhere; Supabase is the only backend.
- Full write path proven end-to-end (browser → API → Stripe + Supabase with linkage) and test data removed.
- Everything the previous session was blocked on is now resolved.
