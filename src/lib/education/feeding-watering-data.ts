    introSummary: 'How and what your pet eats from directly impacts their gastrointestinal health, spinal alignment, and dermatological condition. Porous plastics harbor bacterial biofilms that cause stubborn feline chin acne and canine muzzle folliculitis, while improper eating postures increase air ingestion and bloat risk in deep-chested breeds. This master guide outlines clinical material standards, ergonomic feeding heights, and sanitary hydration protocols for Mid-South dogs and cats.',
